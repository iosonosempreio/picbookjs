picbookJs
-------

A simple Javascript library to display album photos from a Facebook Page.

## Why?

The library was made because we wanted to easily "embed" photos from a Facebook page to our church's [website](http://hillsong.co.uk). Also this would be managed by people with basic understanding of HTML, this is why I tried to keep it simple and without dependencies.

## Installation

- [Download](https://github.com/henriquea/picbookjs/archive/master.zip) ZIP
- Bower: `bower install picbookjs`

## Getting Started

This is the simple way to get the ball rolling.

### Basic usage

Include the `picbook.min.js` before the `</body>` tag. Then initialise the library:

```html
<div class="picbook"></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="picbook.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  (function($)){
    var picbook = new picbookJs({
      albumId: '10150167782373951'
    });
  })(jQuery);
</script>
```

### Options

Those are the options avaliable when you initialise the library:

| Parameter         | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _albumId_         | The Facebook album ID (required)                                       |
| _albumLoaded_     | Provide a callback as soon the album is loaded.                        |
| _photosLoaded_    | Callback a function when the photos are loaded.                        |
| _limit_           | Number of photos to be loaded. The maximum allower by Facebook is 100. |

Example:

```javascript
var options = {
  albumId: '10150167782373951',
  limit: 10,
  albumLoaded: function() { /* do something */ },
  photosLoaded: function() { /* do something else */ }
};

var picbook = new picbookJs(options);
```

## Questions

#### Where do I get the album ID?

Go to an album page and copy the _ID_ from the address bar URL:

#### How about retrieve an album that belongs to a user?

Not possible. The `user_photo` [permission](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/login/#permissions) is required, which means you would have to create a Facebook app and implement the Facebook Login.

#### How about pagination?

This is in my _TODO_ list. For now you can set a `limit` to 100 (maximum allowed by Facebook).
